Building a site site using fastapi framework. It's an ongoing project. I will be developing gradually the security part, Integrating CI/CD pipeline, automating deployment.

Prequisites:-

The code is shipped using docker to a container and we have to start the containers.
To check whether containers are running or not.
try "docker ps" , you will see two processes one for web and another for nginx.
